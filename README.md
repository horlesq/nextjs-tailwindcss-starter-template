# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Starter Template

A minimal, unopinionated starter template for building modern web applications with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). This template provides a clean foundation with basic configuration, placeholder components, and clear instructions for customization. All project-specific logic, branding, authentication, and data dependencies have been removed.

## Features

-   Next.js 14+ with App Router
-   Tailwind CSS configured and ready to use
-   Example layout, header, footer, and navigation components
-   Minimal, generic page structure (Home, About, Contact, Items)
-   Placeholder assets and content
-   ESLint and Prettier configuration

## Getting Started

To create a new project using this template:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url> your-project-name
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

4. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your app.**

## Customization

-   Replace placeholder content in `src/app/` and `src/components/` with your own pages and components.
-   Update or remove placeholder images in the `public/` directory.
-   Edit `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.mjs` to adjust styling as needed.
-   Remove or add dependencies in `package.json` as your project requires.

## Folder Structure

-   `src/app/` – Main application pages and layouts
-   `src/components/` – Reusable UI components
-   `public/` – Static assets (images, favicon, etc.)
-   `tailwind.config.js` – Tailwind CSS configuration
-   `postcss.config.mjs` – PostCSS configuration
